# MontyHallSimulator
Create a simulator to demonstrate via the law of large numbers the probability in the Monty Hall Problem

The problem description can be viewed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

The program simply runs the Monty Hall problem a large number of times, seeding the randomness off of the current time.
Due to the law of large numbers, if run a sufficient number of times the probability will work out to 1/3 and 2/3 to open the goat and car doors, respectively, as opposed to 50/50 as intuition would dictate
